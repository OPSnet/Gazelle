Subject: Orpheus Development Papers #1 - Mysql Roles
Version: 1

The default Gazelle installation defines a single Mysql role (with full
privileges) and used for everything: the website, Ocelot and Sphinx. If any
of these systems are compromised through an SQL injection, it is possible to
wreak any amount of havoc: dropping tables, and even the entire database.

Orpheus uses a set of roles, each dedicated to a single purpose. Each role
has the strict minimum privileges granted to only the necessary tables.

The remaining DROP privileges are for performing TRUNCATE operations.

You should define names (be creative!) for the following roles:

admin   - e.g. adm (a non-privileged user on the system to run phinx)
sphinx  - e.g. spx
tracker - e.g. trk
website - e.g. www

These mysql roles should be configured with different passwords and used in
the following places:

    /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
    /var/www/gazelle/lib/config.override.php
    /var/www/ocelot/ocelot.conf

In practice, the roles will probably have specific IP addresses. localhost
is used as an example. Adapt according to your architecture.
