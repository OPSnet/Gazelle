Subject: Orpheus Development Papers #4 - Witness Tables
Version: 2

This technique is a response to a problem that exists in the original
Gazelle implementation. There are many wide tables (that is, tables with
dozens of columns) that suffer during updates.

On Orpheus, lock contentions when updating users_info.LastReadNews can
sometimes result in fifty second response times. Similar problems occur with
LastReadNews and CatchupTime. The contentions are probably due to scheduled
tasks wanting to update other fields at the same time, or people opening
multiple tabs at once. Taken together, this results in a degraded user
experience 10-12 times a day.

The idea, then, is to encapsulate the logic for keeping track of what has
been read, or when it was read, in separate tables. At the moment, only
integer ids and datestamps are implemented. Other contentious columns can be
addressed in the future.

All that is needed is a table that stores (user_id, thing_id) tuples, in the
case of blog and news posts. The details to determine thing_id is handled in
the witness() method (which will always be the "last", i.e., most recent).
The user_id is passed in as an argument, and this tuple is passed to the
parent witnessValue() method.

In the case of the forum, the need is for a global "I have read everything"
timestamp to perform a catchup (rather than adding/updating a reference to
every single thread. In this case, a (user_id, datestamp) tuple is required.
The witness() method calls the parent witnessDate() method directly, which
in turn records the SQL value of now() in the datestamp field.

Witness is a bit of dumb name. I might rename it if I have a better idea.

After applying the first commit to begin writing to the tables, the
following catch-up queries are run:

1. Forum catchup is trivial, because most people never issue a global
catchup.

INSERT INTO user_read_forum (user_id, last_read)
SELECT ui.UserID, ui.CatchupTime
FROM users_info ui
LEFT JOIN user_read_forum urf ON (urf.user_id = ui.UserID)
WHERE ui.CatchupTime IS NOT NULL
    AND urf.user_id IS NULL;

2. Blog and news are a little more complicated, because the users_info
table uses 0 to represent "has not read anything", so those rows must
be excluded to avoid referential integrity errors.

For these rows, we insert a row that represents the last news item or
blog article that was written before they joined.

Going forward, all newly created accounts will be considered as having
read the most recent blog and news items.

Note: since the time this article was written, the column
users_info.JoinDate has been superceded by the column users_main.created
The follow queries must be adapted in light of that.

INSERT INTO user_read_blog (user_id, blog_id)
SELECT ui.UserID, ui.LastReadBlog
FROM users_info ui
LEFT JOIN user_read_blog urb ON (urb.user_id = ui.UserID)
WHERE ui.LastReadBlog != 0
    AND urb.user_id IS NULL;

INSERT INTO user_read_news (user_id, news_id)
SELECT ui.UserID, ui.LastReadNews
FROM users_info ui
LEFT JOIN user_read_news urn ON (urn.user_id = ui.UserID)
WHERE ui.LastReadNews != 0
    AND urn.user_id IS NULL;

INSERT INTO user_read_blog (user_id, blog_id)
SELECT ui.UserID, max(b_max.ID)
FROM users_info ui, blog b_max
WHERE ui.LastReadBlog = 0
    AND b_max.Time < ui.JoinDate
GROUP BY ui.UserID;

INSERT INTO user_read_news (user_id, news_id)
SELECT ui.UserID, max(n_max.ID)
FROM users_info ui, news n_max
WHERE ui.LastReadNews = 0
    AND n_max.Time < ui.JoinDate
GROUP BY ui.UserID;
