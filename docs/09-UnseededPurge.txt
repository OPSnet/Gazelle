Subject: Orpheus Development Papers #9 - Unseeded Purges
Version: 1

For various reasons, some uploads will end up in an unseeded state, either
because the uploader forgets to load it into their client so no-one else can
snatch it, or eventually people lose interest and stop seeding, hard disks
fail, and the upload becomes unavailable.

There is a tension to be resolved between a site which appears to have a
large catalogue but full of tombstones, and a site with a smaller catalogue
with pretty much everything is available. Different sites resolve the issue
using different policies. The design described below can handle most use
cases.

The original Gazelle design removed tombstones but allowed little margin for
error. There was an initial alert sent for uploads that had been unseeded
for a specified amount of time, which was run as an hourly scheduled task
that caught all the uploads that had been unseeded for between N and N+1
hours. If the scheduler did not make the run in that hour, no notification
alerts were sent and the upload was removed afterwards with no prior
warning.

This became a massive problem if the reaper has to be stopped for an
extended period of time for whatever reason (hardware crash, server move,
DDoS or other instabilities). When things return to normal, starting up the
reaper would immediately nuke a large number of uploads that might otherwise
have been saved if people received an advance warning to do something about
it.

To get around this problem. the approach to handling unseeded uploads on
Orpheus is to use a table to register where an upload is in its unseeded
state. A row is inserted into the `torrent_unseeded` table when it is deemed
to have been unseeded for too long. From there, the row will either be
removed when the upload is seeded once more, or removed along with the purge
of the upload. Unseeded and "never seeded" uploads are managed using
different schedules.

The Orpheus reaper sends out an initial alert well in advance, to give
people time to even notice the message and do something about it. A second
alert is sent just before the upload is removed.

To leave tombstones in the catalogue, simply disable the scheduled reaper
task.

An unseeded upload is identified by the `torrents_leech_stats.last_action`
column. If it is `NULL`, the upload was never seeded. Once the grace period
since creation (based on `torrents.Time`) has passed, a "never seeded" row
is inserted. If there is a value for `last_action` and the grace period for
unseeded uploads has passed, then an "unseeded" row is inserted.

The current timestamp is recorded when the row is inserted. The subsequent
actions (second alert, ultimate removal) are based on this. If a member
pleads for extra time to get their act together, this can be done by
updating the `unseeded_date` to a time in the future (e.g. `now() + INTERVAL
2 WEEK`. There is no point deleting the row: it will be inserted again
during the next scheduler run.

Snatchers are also pinged to see if they can reseed the upload. The first
person to do so can "claim" the reseed and receive a reward of bonus points.
This is to obviate the risk of a snatcher letting the upload be removed and
then reuploaded under their own name. To prevent abuse, a given upload may
only be claimed once by the same person. The `torrent_unseeded_claim` table
can be reviewed to see if an individual is making excessive use of the
feature.

Unseeded uploads are removed after `REMOVE_UNSEEDED_HOUR` hours (28 days by
default). "Never seeded" uploads are removed after
`REMOVE_NEVER_SEEDED_HOUR` hours (3 days by default). The final alert timer
is most easily defined by calculating an interval prior to the removal
deadline.

To spread the load following a long pause, no more than 100 uploads per
user, and no more than 1000 users are considered in a single run. This helps
produce a breadth-first search, rather than depth first. There is also a
maximum cap of total uploads to process per run.

Remember: the `torrent_unseeded` represents the current state of unseeded
notifications. No real harm will happen if the table is truncated: all this
will do is reinitialize the process. The current stats can be viewed in the
Torrent Stats toolbox.
