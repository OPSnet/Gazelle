<h4>Instructions for use</h4>

<div class="box pad">
<p>This editor manages tag names and their duplicates. At the most simplest, it
allows errors to be corrected, such as "rokc" &rarr; "rock". If the error
happens freqently (usually due to scripts that mangle sources such as Discogs or
Musicbrainz), an alias can be added so that new uses of the tag are corrected
automatically.</p>

<p>If a tag is merged into a non-existent tag, the action becomes equivalent to
a renaming. If the tag is important enough to appear in drop-down autocompletion
lists, it can be marked as official.</p>

<p>If a tag needs to be split into two or more distinct tags, use a
comma-separated list in the Merge field. For instance,
"electronicambientexperimental" would be merged to "electronic, ambient,
experimental" and the torrents or requests with that tag would have the three
new tags applied separately.</p>

<p>Depending on the historical contents of tags, there may be some tags that are
no longer able to be specified. For instance, as of May 2020, it is no longer
possible to create double-dotted tags (e.g. space..rock). When cleaning out
broken legacy tags, you may need to check "Do not sanitize".</p>
