<p>Some people are in the recovered backup, some are not. If you had registered before 2017-06-18,
you are in. You will need to supply only your username and email or announce key.</p>

<p>If you signed up afterwards, or you have lost (or never received) your invite email, things are a
little more complicated. We will consider any proof you may be able to supply, such as the complete
signup email, or screenshots of your profile page. Staff has the final say in whether the proof is
sufficient.</p>

<p><b>You can fill out and send this form only once.</b></p>

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/recovery.php?action=save">

<h5>Your username</h5>

<p>Should be obvious â€“ your username on the previous site. When you receive your invite link, you have the
chance to change it to something else if that is your wish.</p>

<input type="text" name="username" />

<h5>Your email</h5>

<p>The email address used for registration. If you changed your address at some point, any address
is valid, assuming it is the the backup.</p>

<input type="text" name="email" />

<h5>Your Password</h5>

<p>This will be hashed upon reception and compared with the existing hash of your password.
When you receive an invite to {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}, you should not reuse this password.</p>

<input type="password" name="password" />

<h5>Your announce key</h5>

<p>You can look this up by viewing the properties of an APL torrent. The key is a long string of
hexadecimal (digits 0 to and 9 and letters A to F) characters. This is optional, but provides
additional proof that you are who you say you are and can be used in lieu of a password.</p>

<input type="text" name="announce" />

<h5>Your original APL/XNX invitation</h5>

<p>Please copy-paste the original raw message.</p>

<p>In Protonmail, this requires two steps. Firstly, you need to obtain the headers. View the message
and hover over the rightmost button (More) in the navigation bar. Choose "View Headers". Copy and
paste this into the field below. Then copy the text body of the message.</p>

<p>In Gmail, this is "View Original". In Exchange and Thunderbird, this is "View Source".
Other mail clients will have similar options.</p>

<p>If you signed up after 2017-06-18, your account is not in the backup. If you have an
invitation email, this is accepted proof.</p>

<textarea rows="8" columns="80" name="invite"></textarea>

<h5>Screenshots</h5>

<p>Bundle up any screenshots or HTML "Save as" copies of your profile into a tarball, or any
standard archive format, compressed as you see fit. We should be able to figure out most formats.
Size is limited to 10MiB. Only HTML and PNG and JPEG image formats are accepted. All other
filetypes will be discarded.</p>

<input type="file" name="screen" />

<h5>Additional information</h5>

<p>You may optionally supply any additional information you deem necessary, such as your final
user class on Apollo as you remember it.</p>

<textarea rows="4" columns="80" name="info"></textarea>

<p>Upon clicking "Send", your uploaded information will be stored, validated and then reviewed by
Staff. If everything checks out, an invite email will be sent to your address.  Information you
supply will be stored in a holding pen and will be deleted after thirty days (so if you haven't
heard back by then, you never will).</p>

<p>On the next page, a unique token will be generated for you. You should make a note of it, as it
can be used as an identifier on the IRC #recovery channel if you need to get in touch with us.
Never paste it in any channel, a Staff member will ask you to send it via a private message.</p>

<input type="submit" value="Send" />

<p>Rate limiting applies. You cannot submit this form more than once every five minutes from the
same IP address.</p>
