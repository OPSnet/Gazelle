Dear {{ username }},

At {{ now }} UTC, a request from {{ ipaddr }} was received
to change your email address for {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}.

The new address is {{ new_email }} . Please take a moment to
verify that you did not made a mistake when entering it.

If you made this change then you may safely ignore this message.

If you did not request this change yourself, or do not recognize the
address, then either someone has guessed your password or you left a
session logged in somewhere. In either case, you should contact us
immediately. Come to {{ constant('BOT_SERVER') }} and join the {{ constant('BOT_DISABLED_CHAN') }} channel.

If you receive another email saying your password was changed
and you did not request it, you account has almost certainly
been taken over by a third party.

The useragent string sent by the browser was:
{{ user_agent }}
