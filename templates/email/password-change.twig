Dear {{ username }},

At {{ now }} UTC, a request from {{ ipaddr }} was received
to change your password for {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}.

If you made this change then you may safely ignore this message.

If you did not request this change yourself then either someone has
guessed your existing password or you left a session logged in
somewhere. In either case, you should contact us immediately.
Come to {{ constant('BOT_SERVER') }} and join the {{ constant('BOT_DISABLED_CHAN') }} channel.

If you receive another email saying your email address was
changed and you did not request it, you account has almost
certainly been taken over by a third party.

The useragent string sent by the browser was:
{{ user_agent }}
