<div class="para">Orpheus with his lute made trees<br />
And the mountain tops that freeze<br />
Bow themselves when he did sing:<br />
To his music plants and flowers<br />
Ever sprung; as sun and showers<br />
There had made a lasting spring.</div>

<div class="para">Every thing that heard him play,<br />
Even the billows of the sea,<br />
Hung their heads and then lay by.<br />
In sweet music is such art,<br />
Killing care and grief of heart<br />
Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</div>
