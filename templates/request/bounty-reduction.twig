With regret, Staff informs you that a reduction of {{ bounty|octet_size }} bounty has been applied to a request you filled on {{ fill_date }}.

It was determined that a person who had voted on this request was manipulating their ratio and as a consequence their request votes have been rescinded. One of the requests affected was this one, and as a result your upload stats have changed.
It fills us with sadness to have to undertake such an action, however, the buffer they dumped on the request was never real in the first place.
