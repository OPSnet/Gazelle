<strong>Ratio System Overview:</strong>
<br />
<ul>
        
    <li>Your <strong>ratio</strong> is calculated by dividing the amount of
    data you&apos;ve uploaded by the amount of data you&apos;ve downloaded.
    You can view your ratio in the site header or in the &quot;stats&quot;
    section of your user profile.</li>

    <li>To maintain <strong>leeching privileges</strong>, your ratio must
    remain above a minimum value. This minimum value is your
    <strong>required ratio</strong>.</li>

    <li>If your ratio falls below your required ratio, you will be given two
    weeks to raise your ratio back above your required ratio. During this
    period, you are on <strong>ratio watch</strong>.</li>

    <li>If you fail to raise your ratio above your required ratio in the
    allotted time, your leeching privileges will be revoked. You will be
    unable to download more data. Your account will remain enabled.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Required Ratio Overview:</strong>
<br />
<ul>

    <li>Your required ratio represents the minimum ratio you must maintain
    to avoid ratio watch. You can view your required ratio in the site
    header after the word &quot;required&quot; or in the &quot;stats&quot;
    section of your user profile.</li>

    <li>Your required ratio is unique; each person&apos;s required ratio is
    calculated for their account specifically.</li>

    <li>Your required ratio is calculated using (1) the total amount of data
    you&apos;ve downloaded and (2) the total number of torrents you&apos;re
    seeding. The seeding total is not limited to snatched torrents
    (completed downloads)&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the total includes, but is not
    limited to, your uploaded torrents./li>

    <li>The required ratio system lowers your required ratio when you seed a
    greater number of torrents. The more torrents you seed, the lower your
    required ratio will be. The lower your required ratio is, the less
    likely it is that you&apos;ll enter ratio watch.</li>

<strong>Required Ratio Calculation:</strong>
<br />
<ul>
    
    <li><strong>1: Determine the maximum and minimum possible values of your
    required ratio.</strong> Using the table above, determine your amount
    downloaded bracket from the first column.  Next, locate the values in
    the adjacent columns. The second column lists the maximum required ratio
    for each bracket, and the third column lists the minimum required ratio
    for each bracket. The maximum and minimum required ratios are also
    referred to as the <strong>0% seeded</strong> and <strong>100%
    seeded</strong> required ratios, respectively.</li>

    <li><strong>2: Determine the actual required ratio.</strong> Your actual
    required ratio will be a number that falls between the maximum and
    minimum required ratio values determined in the previous step. To
    determine your actual required ratio, the system first uses the maximum
    required ratio (0% seeded) and multiplies it by the value [1 &minus;
    (<var>seeding</var> / <var>snatched</var>)]. Formatted differently, the
    calculation performed by the system looks like this:

        <br />
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="static/blank.gif" alt="required ratio = (maximum required ratio) * (1 - (seeding / snatched))"
                    onload="if (this.src.substr(this.src.length - 9, this.src.length) == 'blank.gif') { this.src = 'https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chf=bg,s,FFFFFF00&amp;chl=%5Ctextrm%7B%28maximum+required+ratio%29+%2A+%281-%5Cfrac%7Bseeding%7D%7Bsnatched%7D%29%7D&amp;chco=' + hexify(getComputedStyle(this.parentNode, null).color); }" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>In this formula, <var>snatched</var> is the number of non-deleted
            unique snatches you have made. If you snatch a torrent twice, it only
            counts once. If a snatched torrent is deleted from the site, it is not
            counted at all.</li>

            <li>In this formula, <var>seeding</var> is the average number of
            torrents you&apos;ve seeded over a 72 hour period within the last week.
            If you&apos;ve seeded a torrent for less than 72 hours within the last
            week, it will not raise your seeding total. Please note that while it is
            possible to seed more torrents than you have snatched, the system
            effectively caps the value at 100% of your snatched amount.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>3: Round, if necessary.</strong> The value determined in the
    previous step is rounded up to your minimum required ratio (100% seeded) if
    necessary. This step is required because most amount downloaded brackets have a
    minimum required ratio (100% seeded) greater than zero, and the value returned
    by the above calculation is zero when seeding equals snatched.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Required Ratio Details:</strong>
<br />
<ul>

    <li>If you stop seeding for one week, your required ratio will become the
    maximum required ratio (0% seeded) for your amount downloaded bracket. Once you
    have resumed seeding for a 72 hour period, your required ratio will decrease
    according to the above calculations.</li>

    <li>If your download total is less than 5 GB, you won&apos;t be eligible for
    ratio watch, and you will not need a required ratio. In this circumstance, your
    required ratio will be zero regardless of your seeding percentage.</li>

    <li>If your download total is less than 20 GB and you are seeding a number of
    torrents equal to 100% of your snatches, your required ratio will be zero.</li>

    <li>As your download total increases, your minimum (100% seeded) and maximum (0%
    seeded) required ratios taper together. After you have downloaded 100 GB, those
    values become equal to each other. This means that users with download totals
    greater than or equal to 100 GB have a minimum required ratio (100% seeded) of
    0.60 from that point forward.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Required Ratio Example:</strong>
<br />
<ul>

    <li>In this example, Rippy has downloaded 25 GB. Rippy falls into the
    20&ndash;30 GB amount downloaded bracket in the table above. Rippy&apos;s
    maximum required ratio (0% seeded) is 0.30, and his minimum required ratio (100%
    seeded) is 0.05.</li>

    <li>In this example, Rippy has snatched 90 torrents, and is currently seeding 45
    torrents.</li>

    <li>To calculate Rippy&apos;s actual required ratio, we take his maximum
    required ratio (0% seeded), which is 0.30, and multiply it by [1 &minus;
    (<var>seeding</var> / <var>snatched</var>)] (which is 0.50). Written
    out:
        <samp>0.30 * [1 &minus; (45 / 90)] = 0.15</samp>
    </li>

    <li>The resulting required ratio is 0.15, which falls between the maximum
    required ratio of 0.30 and the minimum required ratio of 0.05 for his amount
    downloaded bracket.</li>

    <li>If Rippy&apos;s on-site required ratio was listed as a value greater than
    the calculated value, this would be because he hadn&apos;t seeded those 45
    torrents for a 72 hour period in the last week. In this case, the system would
    not be counting all 45 torrents as seeded.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Ratio Watch Overview:</strong>
<br />
<ul>

    <li>Everyone gets to download their first 5 GB before ratio watch
    eligibility begins.</li>

    <li>If you&apos;ve downloaded more than 5 GB and your ratio does not meet or
    surpass your required ratio, you will be put on ratio watch and have
    <strong>two weeks</strong> to raise your ratio above your required
    ratio.</li>

    <li>If you download 10 GB while on ratio watch, your leeching privileges
    will automatically be disabled.</li>

    <li>If you fail to leave ratio watch within a two week period, you will lose
    leeching privileges. After losing leeching privileges, you will be unable to
    download more data. Your account will remain enabled.</li>

    <li>The ratio watch system is automated and cannot be interrupted by
    staff.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Leaving Ratio Watch:</strong>
<br />
<ul>

    <li>To leave ratio watch, you must either raise your ratio by uploading more, or
    lower your required ratio by seeding more. Your ratio must be equal to or above
    your required ratio in order for ratio watch to end.</li>

    <li>If you fail to improve your ratio by the time ratio watch expires and lose
    leeching privileges, your required ratio will be temporarily set to the maximum
    possible requirement (as if 0% of snatched torrents were being seeded).</li>

    <li>After losing leeching privileges, in order to adjust the required ratio so
    that it reflects the actual number of torrents being seeded, you must seed for a
    combined 72 hours within a weeklong period. After 72 hours of seeding occur, the
    required ratio will update to reflect your current seeding total, just as it
    would for a leech-enabled user.</li>

    <li>Leeching privileges will be restored once your ratio has become greater than
    or equal to your required ratio.</li>
