    <ul>
        <li>Collages in the Discography, Staff Picks, Label, and Charts
        categories must be based on fact, and not opinion. If something is a
        published Best Of (for instance, "Pitchfork's Best Albums of the
        1990's") then it should go in the Charts category.</li>

        <li>Collages in the Personal, Theme, and Genre Introductions categories
        may be based on opinion. You must respect others' opinions whilst
        creating and populating Theme and Genre Introduction collages.</li>

        <li>Vandalizing of collages will be taken very seriously, resulting in
        collage editing privileges being removed (at a minimum).</li>

        <li>Personal Best Of collages are only allowed in the new Personal
        Collages category. You must be a Power User+ or Donor to create
        one.</li>

        <li>A well-defined group of people, for instance Torrent Masters, or
        Interviewers, may create a Group Picks Theme collage with one pick per
        person, after having gained permission for the collage from
        Staff.</li>

        <li>There may only be one collage per Genre Introduction/Theme. Dupe
        collages will be deleted.</li>

        <li>Theme/Genre Introduction collages must be sensible, and reasonably
        broad. Those that do not fit this description will be deleted.</li>

        <li>Collages are not an alternative to the tagging system. A collage
        such as 'mathcore torrents' wouldn't be allowed, because it is far more
        appropriate to just tag the torrents as mathcore. Of course, an
        'xysite.com Best 50 Mathcore Albums' collage would be looked upon
        differently.</li>

        <li>Collages should not be used to create artist discographies, as the
        artist pages already exist for this purpose. However, for an artist who
        has a multitude of side projects, it is allowed to create a collage
        containing all of the projects, to be placed in the Discography
        category.</li>

        <li>Power Users and Donors get one personal collage. Elites can have
        two, Torrent Masters can have up to three, Power TMs up to four and
        Elite TM+ up to five. Donors always receive one more than the class
        maximum.</li>

        <li>Every collage must have at least 3 torrent groups in it, except for
        collages of type "Label", "Personal", and "Staff Picks".</li>

        <li>Please check to see that a similar collage does not already exist.
        If a similar collage does exist, please contribute to the existing
        collage.</li>

        <li>Please give your collage an appropriate title and a decent
        description explaining its purpose.</li>

        <li>Please attempt to add album art to every torrent in your
        collage.</li>
