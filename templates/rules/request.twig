    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not make requests for torrents that break the rules.</strong>
        It is your responsibility that the request follows the rules. Your request
        will be deleted, and you will not get your bounty back. Requests cannot be
        more specific than the upload (and trumping) rules. For example, requesting
        an MP3 torrent with a log when the rules prohibit replacing an MP3 torrent
        without a log. Such a request asks for a duplicate to be uploaded.</li>

        <li><strong>Only one title (application, album, etc.) per request.</strong>
        No requests for multiple albums (e.g. discographies) or vague requirements.
        You may ask for multiple formats, but you cannot specify all of them. For
        example, you may ask for either a FLAC or V0 but not both formats. You may
        also make a list of albums by one artist that satisfies your request, but
        the request can be filled with only one album. Application requests can
        consist of only one application, but may span a range of different versions.
        However, such requests can be filled with only one version of that
        title.</li>

        <li><strong>Do not unfill requests for trivial reasons.</strong> If you did
        not specify in your request what you wanted (such as bitrates or a
        particular edition), do not unfill and later change the description. Do not
        unfill requests if you are unsure of what you are doing (e.g. the filled
        torrent may be a transcode, but you don't know how to tell). Ask for help
        from <a href="/staffpm.php">first-line support (FLS) or Staff</a> in that
        case. You may unfill the request if the torrent does not fit your
        specifications stated clearly in the request. If the torrent is unseeded,
        you should report the torrent and may unfill it only after it is deleted.</li>

        <li><strong>All users must have an equal chance to fill a request.</strong>
        Trading upload credit is not allowed. Abusing the request system to exchange
        favors for other users is not tolerated. That includes making specific
        requests for certain users (whether explicitly named or not). Making
        requests for releases, and then unfilling so that one particular user can
        fill the request is not allowed. If reported, both the requester and user
        filling the request will receive a warning and lose the request bounty.</li>

        <li><strong>No manipulation of the requester for bounty.</strong> The bounty
        is a reward for helping other users&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it should not be a
        ransom. Any user who refuses to fill a request unless the bounty is
        increased will face harsh punishment.</li>
    </ul>
