/* The purpose of the UserRank classes is to add a level of abstraction
 * to the calculation of user ranks (most uploaded, most forum posts).
 * The aim is to drive as much as possible from a static configuration
 * table and have the code do its work, to allow other users of Gazelle
 * to add different dimensions to ranks without have to monkey patch
 * the internals.
 *
 * It begins with a RANKING_WEIGHT table in the configuration, which
 * specifies the weight a dimension has towards the overall score, and
 * a class name X that points to \Gazelle\UserRank\X.
 *
 * To explore and test in Boris:
 * Consider that there are two users, one who has up/down votes a
 * single release, and another who has voted on two:
 *
 *  > $config = new Gazelle\UserRank\Configuration(RANKING_WEIGHT);
 *  > $config->instance('votes')->build();
 *  // array(
 *  //   0 => 1,
 *  //   1 => 2
 *  // )
 *  > $config->instance('votes')->rank(0);
 *  // 0
 *  > $config->instance('votes')->rank(1);
 *  // 50
 *  > $config->instance('votes')->rank(2);
 *  // 100
 *  > $config->instance('votes')->rank(3);
 *  // 100
 *
 * The UserRank object adds a wrapper over the top of the config
 * object. It ignores the notion of paranoia, so metrics must be
 * set to 0 when calculating the rank of paranoid people.
 *
 * Adding a new dimension should be as simple as adding an entry to the
 * RANKING_WEIGHT table and writing a new class in app/UserRank/<whatever>.php
 * This then has to hooked up to sections/user/user.php and
 * sections/ajax/user.php
 *
 * Future directions: pass a \Gazelle\User object to the UserRank
 * object, and define the appropriate ethod names in the ranking
 * table so that the dimension classes can obtain the metrics
 * directly and not need to have them passed in.
